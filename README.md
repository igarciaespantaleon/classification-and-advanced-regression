# Advanced Modeling Project: Classification & Regression

This repository contains the final project for the **Advanced Modeling** course of the Master in Computational Social Sciences at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.  
The project explores two predictive modeling tasks using customer behavior data:

- **Classification (churn prediction):** I trained models ranging from a simple benchmark to more advanced methods, including **multinomial logistic regression, regularized regression, decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting**.  
- **Regression (average transaction value):** I tested both linear and nonlinear approaches, including **linear regression, elastic net, stepwise feature selection, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting, and a neural network**.  


## Repository Contents
- **churn.csv** — dataset used for analysis
- **final_project.Rmd** — full reproducible analysis in R Markdown
- **final_project.html** — rendered report with results and figures
